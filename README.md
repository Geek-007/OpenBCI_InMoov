# InMoov_OpenBCI

This repo contains the ongoing development of the connection between [OpenBCI board](http://www.openbci.com/) and the [InMoov Right Hand & Forearm](http://www.inmoov.fr/hand-and-forarm/). OpenBCI is a powerful, high-channel count EMG device in addition to being capable of sampling brain activity. As a result, I think it would be awesome to develop a 8 or 16 channel EMG controlled robotic hand. I believe the implications for low-cost, high-quality, 3D-printable prosthetics are big!
